Working off of the iconic track Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence, *DJ Stuiter* created a wonderful electronic track, with unique synths and plucks used throughout, small helpings of strings and orchestral elements, this track is perfect for the Christmas period!

        One of the most beautfiul pieces of music I've ever heard in my life, I wanted to see if I could do anything with it, originally it was actually a Euphoric Hardstyle remix but then it ended up being more Ambient and then chill similar to Iridescent and some upcoming tracks, pretty happy with the final result

        I actually made this track originally in 2023, where the chord progression of the song was in my head the whole year and then around late october in the year I made a quick drop idea which I sent to DarkK Emo to work on and eventually led to the collab, there's honestly a few times between classes at school where I worked on this track lmao
