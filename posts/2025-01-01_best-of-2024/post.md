As 2024 comes to a close, so does our year of music, and to celebrate, we'll be releasing the best tracks of the year in
a compilation album today!

## <a class="button cta" href="https://untonemusic.com/release/best-of-2024">Listen here!</a>

<br>


For a month, we ran community and internal voting to decide two categories of the "best" tracks:

- 10 Community picks
- 10 Staff picks

In this blogpost, we'll be covering the results of both, the highlights of each track, and for the staff picks, why we
think personally they're worthy of the Best of 2024 title!

Warning: Descriptions were written as fast as possible since we had to finish them before the song ended. Help.

One of the most iconic tracks of UNTONE Music, *Iridescent* by *DJ Stuiter* joins us in the first track of Best of 2024! A chill electronic track loved by all of us here in UNTONE Music, and clearly everyone in the community too, scoring the highest of all the tracks!

        This was around the time I was experimenting with new sounds, as working on the same genre consistently was starting to get demotivating over time. I made this track as an escape, to try to experiment and make something unique, this was the result and I think it turned out great.

Although this track technically released in 2021, it's first debut on UNTONE Music was on the 2024 album Runes! This track is one of dljzt's first works and contains various genres blended together with pure skill to create a flawless music.

A remix of the iconic track *A Shopping Spree* from PRELIMINARY BURST, *A Shopping Spree ~ Reimagined* grabs the original and reimagines it better than ever before, with smooth piano and chill drums, similar in vibe to Iridescent!

People cleary loved this track, as it got very high up in the community voting. Who couldn't love that smooth jazzy piano alongside the chill electronic drums and subtle *DJ Stuiter*!

The latest release form *Sky Max* collaboratnig with *Orion Midnight* hits hard with vocals from the amazing *Allysa Asea* and soft electronic synths and sounds throughout!

With heavy synths and punchy bass, *DJ Stuiter* comes in with another banger! Making use of very bouncy sound design alongside good music
<br><br>

<track-player id="609"></track-player>

"BONDU IS NOT IN FULL CAPS" i've been told, but *BONDU*'s track *MARGIN* has made the cut, resonating with the many listeners of UNTONE Music with it's bass-oriented sound design and unique usage of vocal samples and cool synths!

        I made MARGIN as an experimental song. Originally it was a lot less gritty, and sounded almost totally different. After revising it a few times, I thought I was nearly done, but I couldnâ€™t get an idea for the 3rd drop. After sharing the song with a few friends they all agreed it should have a 3rd drop, and I literally made it in an hour in a vc. Overall this song was just meant to be a kinda an experiment to base future bass house songs on, but I eventually decided on submitting it here, and it has been welcomed with levels of enjoyment for the song I was never expecting to see.

<br><br>

*DAVR*'s here with their remix of *Iridescent*! Completely reworking the chill track to add more up-beat elements and energetic synths and melodies, this truly is one of the remixes of all time!

# Staff Picks
There were lots of amazing tracks which sadly didn't make the cut of the top 10 community picks. We've picked our personal favourites as Staff Picks!

<track-player id="632"></track-player>

We're rather shocked this one wasn't included in the community picks. This was one of our favourite tracks this entire year! With wide vocals and very atmospheric sounds, it transports you to another realm with its angelic sounds! We feel this deserved a place on the album! It's banger
<br><br>

<track-player id="629"></track-player>

Because this track was recently released, it didn't get much of a chance to be voted upwards by the community, but it's got to be one of our favourites of this year! With ultra colourful sound design and atmospheric ambience througout!
<br><br>

<track-player id="520"></track-player>

Bliss was released earlier this year, and we've always quite liked the track! *torment.* made use of various sounds and samples throughout the track to make a unique vibe and music!
<br><br>

<track-player id="442"></track-player>

With this song, you'll be DREAMING you had more, with *DREAMER* from *KINOSEI* featuring smooth synths and combining retro sounds with modern approaches!
<br><br>

<track-player id="367"></track-player>

A recreation of an older track, *Corrupted Angel* by *TFD500* makes use of unique sounds taking inspiration from the music of retro rhythm games and other games!

    <p>
        During my time experimenting with the DAW that I was using (which was LMMS), I decided to experiment with a few new genres that you wouldn't normally hear in rhythm games. So I was just goofing around with the default samples, and the rest is history.

Taking inspiration from Y2K-era video games, with jungle and phonk, *Luun*'s *im going in* is an up-beat song easy to vibe and dance to! 
<div class="message">

    <p>
        Ooh this track... Yeah, this was on the period i started doing completely different genres im used to, being one of those, Jungle. Just like the name of the EP, i was one day bored, scrolling through my sample folder, then i found a sound that sparked something in my brain, so i was like "Oh, i gotta make this a Jungle track" then i started working. After that, i got an idea with a friend (Shoutouts to DyhoCoffee) "What if... I combine Phonk with Jungle?" and tried to make it work, and it did! Then i got mentally blocked, but on that period, i started playing more old racing games, like Rage Racer and Ridge Racer Type-4 for example. Then something sparked on me again, opened FL Studio, found another good sample, and i made a more chill section inspired by those games. Im proud of what i did, is even my most favorite track of my EP

<track-player id="612"></track-player>

Combining orchestral sounds, harder rock-oriented guitars, and up-beat breakcore-esque drums, *ENDLESS* by *Tanza3D* (me :3) is good i promise :3
<br><br>

<track-player id="615"></track-player>

*E-clipse*'s track *MYDNESS* makes heavy use of D&B elements throughout with punchy bass and synths around every corner!
<br><br>

<track-player id="390"></track-player>

With up-beat chopped-vocal-oriented elements, *Sexy Little Misfit* by *DAVR* is arguably one of the sexiest songs in the list! We felt it deserved a place in here for being one of our personal favourites!

        I made a track called "Gen Z Discovers Vinyl LMA9" for my Cyber:Stream album. It had a early-mid 2000s house feel and I wanted to make a sort of successor to the track. I set out to make a better house track with mostly the same feel and managed to finish it within three days. I'm very satisfied with the finished track and it got an overwhelming amount of support from my friends and relatives.

"BOOP BEEP BOOP" says *DJ Stuiter* whilst making *You & Me, Pt. 2*! Created as a sequel to an unreleased song in 2021, *You & Me*, this song completely reimagines the sound and feel of the track, and is one of the best in No Bootable Devices Found!
